## The Problem
   * There is a lot of corruption in the gambling system.
   * In Korea, there is no restriction because it is illegal.
   * Operators are highly likely to be operated.

## How To Solve It?
* It can use a completely **decentralized** platform that operators cannot touch.
* And, any controversial portion of the dividend rate or manipulation is executed within a 100% publicized code.
* ** Profit! **
